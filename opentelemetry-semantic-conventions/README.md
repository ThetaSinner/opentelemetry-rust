## Overview

[`OpenTelemetry`] is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs used to instrument,
generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) for
analysis in order to understand your software's performance and behavior. This
crate provides standardized naming patterns for attributes, and
resources to help facilitate interoperability and compatibility with processing
and visualization tools.
